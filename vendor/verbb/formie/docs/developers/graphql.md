# GraphQL

Formie supports accessing [Form](docs:developers/form) and [Submission](docs:developers/submission) objects via GraphQL. Be sure to read about [Craft's GraphQL support](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/graphql.html).

## Forms

### Query payload

```json
{
    form (handle: "contactForm") {
        title
        handle

        settings {
            errorMessageHtml

    }
}
```

## Submissions

### Query payload

    submissions (form: "contactForm") {
        title

        ... on contactForm_Submission {
            yourName
            emailAddress

#### Nested Fields
An example for querying Repeater and Group field content.

```json
{
    submissions (handle: "contactForm") {
        title
        
        ... on contactForm_Submission {
            groupFieldHandle {
                myFieldHandle
            }

            repeaterFieldHandle {
                rows {
                    myFieldHandle
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Mutations
Mutations in GraphQL provide a way of modifying data. The actual mutations will vary depending on the schema. There are some common mutations per GraphQL object type as well as type-specific mutations.

Be sure to read the [GraphQL docs](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/graphql.html#mutations).

### Submissions

#### Saving a submission

To create or update a submission use the form-specific mutation, which will have the name in the form of `save_<formHandle>_Submission`.

<!-- BEGIN SUBMISSION MUTATION ARGS -->

| Argument | Type | Description
| - | - | -
| `id`| `ID` | Set the element’s ID.
| `uid`| `String` | Set the element’s UID.
| `enabled`| `Boolean` | Whether the element should be enabled.
| `title`| `String` | Set the element’s title.
| `status`| `String` | Set the element’s status as its handle.
| `statusId`| `Int` | Set the element’s statusId.
| `...`|  | More arguments depending on the field layout for the form

<!-- END SUBMISSION MUTATION ARGS -->

The below shows an example request to create a new submission. For this form, we have a single-line text field with the handle `yourName`. In our query variables, we pass the value(s) we want to use in the query.

```json
// Query
mutation saveSubmission($yourName:String) {
    save_contactForm_Submission(yourName: $yourName) {
        title
        yourName
    }
}

// Query Variables
{
    "yourName": "Peter Sherman"
}
```

With the resulting output:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "save_contactForm_Submission": {
            "title": "2020-08-18 10:29:06",
            "yourName": "Peter Sherman"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Complex Fields
Some fields, such as Name and Address fields are much more than primitive values. Instead, their content needs to be provided as an object. The Name field is an exception, as it can be set to have multiple fields, or a single field.

For example, you can populate a name and address field using the below:

```json
// Query
mutation saveSubmission($yourName:contactForm_yourName_FormieNameInput $yourAddress:contactForm_yourAddress_FormieAddressInput) {
    save_contactForm_Submission(yourName: $yourName, yourAddress: $yourAddress) {
        yourName
        yourAddress
    }
}

// Query Variables
{
    "yourName": {
        "firstName": "Peter",
        "lastName": "Sherman"
    },
    "yourAddress": {
        "address1": "42 Wallaby Way",
        "city": "Sydney",
        "zip": "2000",
        "state": "NSW",
        "country": "Australia"
    }
}
```

You'll notice the `contactForm_yourName_FormieNameInput` type being used. This follows the structure of `{formHandle}_{fieldHandle}_FormieNameInput`. There are also a number of other input types to consider.

#### Address Field
```json
// Query
mutation saveSubmission($yourAddress:contactForm_yourAddress_FormieAddressInput) {
    save_contactForm_Submission(yourAddress: $yourAddress) {
        yourAddress
    }
}

// Query Variables
{
    "yourAddress": {
        "address1": "42 Wallaby Way",
        "city": "Sydney",
        "zip": "2000",
        "state": "NSW",
        "country": "Australia"
    }
}
```

#### Group Field
```json
// Query
mutation saveSubmission($groupField:contactForm_groupField_FormieGroupInput) {
    save_contactForm_Submission(groupField: $groupField) {
        groupField {
            firstValue: firstValue
            secondValue: secondValue
        }
    }
}

// Query Variables
{
    "groupField": {
        "firstValue": "This content",
        "secondValue": "is for groups"
    }
}
```

#### Repeater Field
```json
// Query
mutation saveSubmission($repeaterField:contactForm_repeaterField_FormieRepeaterInput) {
    save_contactForm_Submission(repeaterField: $repeaterField) {
        repeaterField {
            rows: {
                field1: field1
                field2: field2
            }
        }
    }
}

// Query Variables
{
    "repeaterField": {
        "rows": [
            {
                "field1": "First Block - Field 1",
                "field2": "First Block - Field 2"
            },
            {
                "field1": "Second Block - Field 1",
                "field2": "Second Block - Field 2"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


#### Deleting a submission

To delete a submission use the `deleteSubmission` mutation, which requires the `id` of the submission that must be deleted. It returns a boolean value as the result to indicate whether the operation was successful.

```json
// Query to delete a submission with ID of `1110` for a site with an ID of `2`.
mutation deleteSubmission {
    deleteSubmission(id:1110 siteId:2)
}
```

With the resulting output:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "deleteSubmission": true
    }
}
```
