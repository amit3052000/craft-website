# Console Commands
Formie comes with a number of command line utilities that can be run on-demand, or on a set schedule.

## Delete Orphaned Fields
A cleanup tasks to ensure fields aren't orphaned. Not normally required.

```
./craft formie/gc/delete-orphaned-fields
```

## Prune Syncs
A cleanup task to ensure Synced Fields are neat. Not normally required.

```
./craft formie/gc/prune-syncs
```

## Prune Incomplete Submissions
Deletes any incomplete submissions that exceed the "Maximum Incomplete Submission Age" plugin setting.

```
./craft formie/gc/prune-incomplete-submissions
```

## Prune Data Retention Submissions
Deletes any submissions that exceed your data retention form settings.

```
./craft formie/gc/prune-data-retention-submissions
```

## Prune Content Tables
A cleanup task to ensure deleted forms have their content tables also deleted. Not normally required.

```
./craft formie/gc/prune-content-tables
```

Each of the above commands are also run automatically through [Craft's Garbage Collection](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/gc.html), so there's no need to add these commands unless you want fine-grained control over when they run.
