# Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous integrations are one of the provided integrations with Formie, and are used for a variety of different needs. These are integrations that don't otherwise fit into any other category.

Formie uses Craft‘s Queue system to send data to third-party providers. When a submission is successful a job is added to the queue so that it can be processed asynchronously.

You can create Miscellaneous integrations by going to **Formie** → **Settings** → **Miscellaneous**. You can pick from a list of providers Formie supports, and provide details for connecting to their respective APIs. You can also created multiple Miscellaneous integrations, in case you need to connect to multiple, different providers.

## Supported Providers
Formie integrates with the following providers:
- Google Sheets
- Monday
- Slack
- Trello

## Local Testing Proxy
Some integration providers are configured through OAuth, which involves a round trip from your Craft install, to the providers authentication servers, and back again. For some providers - like Google - they require your Craft install to be on a public domain with SSL enabled. In practice, you might like to test out the integrations locally on your testing environment, which may not be on a publicly accessible domain.

Formie can help with this, by providing a **Proxy Redirect URI** for some integrations. What this does is modify the URL for the redirect to Verbb servers, to redirect back to your install.

For example, you might have a Redirect URI like the following:

```
http://formie.test/actions/formie/integrations/callback
```

Using this URL for providers won't work, as it'll detect `.test` is a non-public domain name. Using the Proxy Redirect URI will change the redirect URL to be:

```
https://formie.verbb.io?return=http://formie.test/actions/formie/integrations/callback
```

Here, it routes the request through to our Verbb servers, which forwards on the request to the URL in the `return` parameter (which would be your local project).
