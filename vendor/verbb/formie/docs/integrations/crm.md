# CRM
CRM integrations are one of the provided integrations with Formie, and are used for a variety of different needs. Mostly commonly, this integration pushes data related to “Contacts” and “Leads”. Each provider will have different names and available data available to be mapped. For instance, you might want to add someone to a “Potentials” list in your CRM, so you can follow up with later, or build complex automations.

Formie uses Craft‘s Queue system to send data to third-party providers. When a submission is successful a job is added to the queue so that it can be processed asynchronously.

You can create CRM integrations by going to **Formie** → **Settings** → **CRM**. You can pick from a list of providers Formie supports, and provide details for connecting to their respective APIs. You can also created multiple CRM integrations, in case you need to connect to multiple, different providers.

You can also test the connection to the APIs, to ensure that your site and Formie can communicate with the API.

Once created, enabled and connected, these integrations will be available to configure in your forms.

### Refresh Integration
Formie will fetch a number of data objects for the provider - each being specific to the provider. These objects are are cached for performance, you can also refresh the available data objects if they change.

#### Field Mapping
For each data object, Formie will also fetch all available fields, and any provider-specific fields for a particular CRM provider or data object. You can map which Formie fields should have their values connected to their third-party field counterpart. Each field mapping field can be opted-in, in case you don't require mapping content to all data objects.
