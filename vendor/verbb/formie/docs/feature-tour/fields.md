# Fields
Fields are arguably the core of a form, providing users the means to input actual content into a form. With Formie's form builder interface, fields are organised into rows. Each row can have multiple fields (up to 4), allowing fields to be shown in a column layout, side-by-side.

Each field varies by its type, allowing for different functionality and behaviour depending on the field.

Looking for custom fields? Developers can create their own custom fields to extend the functionality of Formie. Read the [Custom Field](docs:developers/custom-field) docs for more.

## Settings
All fields have a standard collection of settings.

Attribute | Description
--- | ---
Label | The label that describes this field.
Handle | How you’ll refer to this field in your templates.
Required | Whether this field should be required when filling out the form.
Error Message | When validating the form, show this message if an error occurs.
Label Position | How the label for the field should be positioned.

Visibility | See below.

### Visibility
You can set any field to be "Hidden" on the front-end. This will still be available in the source of the page, but hidden for general users. You can also set it to be "Disabled", where the field is never rendered on the front-end, but can still have its value set via [Field Population](docs:template-guides/populating-forms). This can be benefitial if you're concerned with tampering of the HTML before submission.

See the full [Field](docs:developers/field) documentation for more.

In addition some fields have some additional specific settings, described below.

## Predefined Field Options
For Dropdown, Checkboxes and Radio Buttons, Formie provides a collection of preset options for common scenarios for you to pick from. This might be useful to quickly populate an entire Dropdown with a list of countries, states, languages, currencies and lots more.

You can also select what content to use for the Label and Value of each option. For instance, you might like to label the option as Australia, but have the value as the abbreviated "AU".
